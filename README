These are my current dotfiles. Depending on the box, I'm either running Debian
Squeeze, Wheezy, Sid or (gasp) Ubuntu, and I typically have no issues with them.

What I do is simply make my dotfile a symlink to the dotfile in the repo, such
as the following:

  ln -s ~/terminal-dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc

For the gitaliases, you can either copy and paste them into your ~/.gitconfig,
or if you have git >= 1.7.10 you can add the following to your .gitconfig file:

  [include]
    path = terminal-dotfiles/gitaliases
