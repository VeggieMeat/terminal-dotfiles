These are my current dotfiles. Depending on the box, I'm either running Debian
Squeeze, Wheezy, or (gasp) Ubuntu, and I typically have no issues with them.

What I do is simply make my dotfile a symlink to the dotfile in the repo, such
as the following:

  ln -s ~/terminal-dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
